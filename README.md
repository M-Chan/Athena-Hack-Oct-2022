# Athena-Hack-Oct-2022

24hr London in-person Hackathon!
We are team Octagon: Michelle Chan, Ariana Dennis, Amy Lee, Elle Daynes and myself!
We created a mobile web app for Showcode's October Athena Hackathon 2022!

We chose BlackRock's 'Improving Financial Inclusion' theme and created an app which aims to educate the younger generation on investing through gamification.

A demo of the app can be seen in the video below
